# FunctionPlotter (Java Swing)
takes an equation, and it plots it through a 2D graph

before we describe the project we should declare some things very important before going deep.

as function plotting graph may be so overwhelming to implement with your self to ensure it works perfectly fine.
going from parsing, validating, printing the output of the equation using any kind of binary tree.
as you may find there are signs with high priority than other like "* , /" than "+ , -".
so I used a jar file from JChart packages located at this website https://mindfusion.eu/java-chart.html.

and we could say easily giving a valid equation (has only X) as a variable and the other must be constants would work.
but as we no nothing is like heaven , this package is trail-version hence it could not work at all equations.

input parameter should be as follow:

1 - function parameter : any equation would work as described in the requirment pdf (+ , - , * , /) and x as the only variable, y your output function.


2 - domain parameter : works only with integers A , B (A is your min domain , B is your max domain)

below there are couple of images for the project we would like you to see.
